# SUDOKU SOLVER
------

### Intro
------
Sudoku is a puzzle, where the objective is to  fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids  
that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
Sudoku is a logic-based and not a math-based puzzle. It is possible to make und solve a Sudoku puzzle with letters or even some symbols.
A little interesting point is that there are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 possible Sudoku puzzles. So we can play umpteen Sudokus a day and there will still be new ones.
