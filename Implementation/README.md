# SUDOKU SOLVER
------

### Intro
Sudoku is a puzzle, where the objective is to  fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids  
that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
Sudoku is a logic-based and not a math-based puzzle. It is possible to make und solve a Sudoku puzzle with letters or even some symbols.
A little interesting point is that there are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 possible Sudoku puzzles. So we can play umpteen Sudokus a day and there will still be new ones.

**[sudokusolver.py](https://github.com/debasish2110/265057_Python_Miniproject/blob/master/Implementation/sudokuSolver.py) is the main file.. we need to run that,**
**and [Test/test.py](https://github.com/debasish2110/265057_Python_Miniproject/blob/master/Implementation/Test/test.py) is the test file.**

* how to run the code and working output along with the testing is recorded and available in the recordings folder and also uploaded on youtube..
